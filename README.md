# android-device-connector-plugin

This plugin lists all connected Android devices to Jenkins (including Slaves).
It can show detailed information of each device and install apk on the selected device.
It requires the adb tools to be installed on the machine were the devices are connected.

This plugin is based on the code from https://github.com/jenkinsci/ios-device-connector-plugin.
